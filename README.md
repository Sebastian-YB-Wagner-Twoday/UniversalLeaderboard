# UniversalLeaderBoard

Universal leaderboard is a simple WebSite in progress, where you can create a invite a group of users, to take part in a bunch of contests as one, and keep track of all scores, and even compete on the amount of contests one are leading in.

Created to practice my Astro, Vue and C# skills.
